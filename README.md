# Airplanes-Detection---Computer-vision
This project focuses on merging datasets for a computer vision task using the YOLOv8 model. It involves setting up the environment, downloading datasets via the Roboflow API, merging them, renaming class labels for consistency, and visualizing samples to ensure data integrity. Contributions are welcome to enhance the project further!
